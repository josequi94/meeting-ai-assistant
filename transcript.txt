[0.00s - 5.16s]  Here, thanks for hopping on. I wanted to quickly touch base about our KPIs and how
[5.16s - 10.04s]  we can tighten things up this quarter. Hey Jose, sure. I've been meaning to talk
[10.04s - 14.52s]  through that too. Where are we standing? So looking at last quarter, we hit about
[14.52s - 20.12s]  85% of our qualified lead target. Our conversion rate held at 12%, an average
[20.12s - 25.00s]  deal size dropped to about 18k, which is down from 22k. Not a terrible quarter,
[25.00s - 29.36s]  but definitely room to push higher. Yeah, I noticed the smaller deal sizes too,
[29.36s - 35.40s]  especially in our mid-market accounts. Right? So here's what I'm thinking. One,
[35.40s - 39.60s]  lead quality. Marketing is tightening audience filters for campaigns. We should
[39.60s - 44.48s]  start seeing better fit leads and I'll track that week over week. Two, conversion
[44.48s - 48.80s]  rates. Let's run tighter discovery. I've drafted a checklist we can try that
[48.80s - 54.32s]  focuses more on budget and urgency in the first call. Three, deal size. We can start
[54.32s - 59.04s]  positioning bundle solutions earlier. I'll coordinate with product to get updated
[59.04s - 63.84s]  materials on value added to the new integrations. I like the chest checklist
[63.84s - 70.00s]  idea. Maybe we can test it on the early pipeline deals this
[70.00s - 75.16s]  week and compare notes. Perfect. Also, I'll put a list of last quarter stall
[75.16s - 79.56s]  deals. We can retarget those with a limited time offer or a new use case
[79.56s - 84.68s]  angle. Yeah, that works. Do you want me to track any pilot metrics and sales force
[84.80s - 92.28s]  for those two? Yes, please. Just tag them as Q2 re-engaged and I'll include them in
[92.28s - 96.36s]  the weekly tracker. And speaking of that, let's do a 15-minute sync every Thursday
[96.36s - 102.72s]  morning to share quick updates and blockers. Sounds good. I'll block time now. Let's
[102.72s - 107.36s]  turn those numbers around. Let's do it. Appreciate you, Erica. Talk Thursday.
[107.36s - 109.08s]  By the way, I want to...
